This repository contains Python scripts which I have written as part of my final year engineering project titled: "A Comparative Analysis of Accuracy and Complexity of Deep Learning Models for Retinal Disease Classification".

For the purpose of this project I've recreated, trained and tested 5 common neural network topologies and compared their performances against each other in detecting abnormalities in OCT scans of human retina.
